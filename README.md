# tempmailnew
This is a TempMail Generator I built with pure html+css+js codes. A beautiful responsive frontend. It uses API from tempmailnew.com.
# Objective
In order to stay anonymous while registering an account in some website, or, in cases that you do not want to expose your private email, you may choose to use a temp mail address generated to receive and burn the mail right after you read it.
# Tecnology
The backend is built with nodejs, faster than php mail servers. Frontend is simple and versatile html+css layout.
# API endpoints
const API_BASE_URL = "https://tempmailnew.com";
/api/emails-list/ 
/api/email/${email}/${emailId}
If you just want to embed a tempmail generator in your site, you can copy the script.js+css and it will work.
